## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `storybook` runs storybook
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project

If you want to start it locally:

  - npm install.
  - start using the "start" script from package.json.
  - navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`

To run tests with code coverage run the "test" script.

This project has Storybook, and a Story for every component implemented.
Check it by running the `storybook` script and afterwards navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

The app is also hosted here: https://bogdanmantaluta.github.io/web-components-app/

Thank you, and happy testing!!
